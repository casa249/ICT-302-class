Dummy Annotated Definitions: this is where we'll do the annotated definitions

Alright, c'mon, I think we're safe.

I'm gonna be at the dance.

You know Marty, you look so familiar, do I know your mother?

he's an idiot, comes from upbringing, parents were probably idiots too. Lorraine, if you ever have a kid like that, I'll disown you.

Well, uh, listen, uh, I really-

Marty, you made it.

That's him.

A colored mayor, that'll be the day.

Ahh.

Never?

Now, now, Biff, now, I never noticed any blindspot before when I would drive it. Hi, son.

We're gonna take a little break but we'll be back in a while so, don't nobody go no where.

So you're my Uncle Joey. Better get used to these bars, kid.

Of course I do. Just a second, let's see if I could find it.

Shut your filthy mouth, I'm not that kind of girl.

Pa, what is it? What is it, Pa?

I'm, I'm sorry, Mr. McFly, I mean, I was just starting on the second coat.

He's fine, and he's completely unaware that anything happened. As far as he's concerned the trip was instantaneous. That's why Einstein's watch is exactly one minute behind mine. He skipped over that minute to instantly arrive at this moment in time. Come here, I'll show you how it works. First, you turn the time circuits on. This readout tell you where you're going, this one tells you where you are, this one tells you where you were. You imput the destination time on this keypad. Say, you wanna see the signing of the declaration of independence, or witness the birth or Christ. Here's a red-letter date in the history of science, November 5, 1955. Yes, of course, November 5, 1955.

Why do you keep following me around?

Right check, Doc.

Doc, wait. No, bastards.

Just turn around, McFly, and walk away. Are you deaf, McFly? Close the door and beat it.

Doc, she didn't even look at him.

This sounds pretty heavy.

No no no this sucker's electrical, but I need a nuclear reaction to generate the one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity that I need.

Well, uh, listen, uh, I really-

Doc, wait. No, bastards.

Marty you gotta come back with me.

He's your brother, Mom.

The way I see it, if you're gonna build a time machine into a car why not do it with some style. Besides, the stainless, steel construction made the flux dispersal- look out.

Now Biff, don't con me.

See, there's Biff out there waxing it right now. Now, Biff, I wanna make sure that we get two coats of wax this time, not just one.

Yeah.

Anyway, Grandpa hit him with the car and brought him into the house. He seemed so helpless, like a little lost puppy, my heart just went out for him.

Hello.

Why not?

Huh?

This is uh, this is heavy duty, Doc, this is great. Uh, does it run on regular unleaded gasoline?

I do understand. If I know too much about my own future I could endanger my own existence, just as you endangered yours.

Well, I guess that's everything.

He's fine, and he's completely unaware that anything happened. As far as he's concerned the trip was instantaneous. That's why Einstein's watch is exactly
