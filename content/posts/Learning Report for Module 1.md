I can define certain concepts in web content management, but not yet define them.
I can compare content management systems, but I still need to become better at describing them.
I can use established workflows to begin to manage content, but not much yet.
I can somewhat identify technologies related to content management but not yet employ them.
I can find resources to help with self-directed learning
