I can now identify and define key concepts such as *datatypes*, which are types of content modeling that are used in CMS's.
I can better compare different CMS's such as *Zoom* and *Teams* but looking for features such as:
* content models
* datatype
* tools 

I can manage content by using established workflows like the *date* feature on Github to choose when and what time my content is available to the world.
I can identify technologies related to content management such as Deputy and Planning Center, which are two CMS's used to schedule employees for work shifts and records their working time.
I can use resources such as the *Official WordPress Support Page* for self-directed learning
