I can identify key concepts such as different content geographies for content management and management systems. 
I can compare CMS's such as *Github* and *WordPress* by comparing their geographies, from botht the editor's and consumer's perspective.
I can manage content using workflows such as "serial" content and "relational" content. 
I can identify and employ technologies such as www.contentmarketinginstitute.com, which is a site designed to help you enhance your content management.
I can use resources such as _www.markdownguide.com_ for self-directed learning.
