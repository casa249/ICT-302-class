I haven't learned too much about key concepts in web content management this week, but I've become more familiar with concepts we've been talking about like uploading content to websites.
I haven't really learned much about different content management systems yet, but I think what we're using in class is really similar to something called Rstudio that we're using in a different class.
I still haven't learned much about established workflows.
Though there is still plenty of work to go, I have learned more about markdown and begun to learn to do things such as: 
<ul>
<li>make bullet points</li>
<li>make headers (first and second)</li>
<li>emphasize phrases</li>
</ul>
This week I've learned about a website called "w3schools.com" that helps to identify what different types of code do.
