I can identify more concepts in content management such as roles in group projects and what each role should do.
I still need to learn about more content management systems, but I now have a good grasp of the effectiveness of Microsoft Teams for future comparrisons.
I have learned more about using established workflows by creating and exploring a new tab in Microsoft Teams which taught me how to make a strong workflow and put it into effect.
I can now recognize more technologies related to content management by examining sources I already have like Microsoft Teams and using them to find good sites and technologies for establishing workflows and communicating about projects. 
I can find and use resources to find more self-directed learning like html and markdown guides.
