I have learned new key concepts in content management such as assisting editors, organization, security, and content delivery.
Though I donâ€™t know too many content management systems yet, I can now describe and compare good qualities of CMSs.
I can now use key concepts in my workflows for both group work and self work.
I can now recognize technologies that can help with content management such as websites with good management qualities.
I haven't made much progress with finding resources for self directed learning, but I can use the sources I already have.
