After this week, I can now identify good presentation in a website such as its layout, color scheme, and spacing.
I still have not learned too much about different content management systems, but I have learned things such as usability and design/layout to help compare them in the future.
I have learned to better organize my content in certain folders or areas of a website for better content management.
I (though not successfully) have learned how to change the theme of a website through github, and hopefully will be more successful in the future.
I can use resources such as coding from other websites as examples, search engines, and more for self-directed learning.
