I can identify key concepts such as:
*usability* and 
*content vs. presentation*.
I can now compare content management systems such as github and WordPress.
I learned to use a team workflow to manage and complete a group project.
I can employ new technologies related to content management such as WordPress, the site we've learned about this week for our group blog posts.
I have learned about both official and unofficial resources to help with self-directed learning in WordPress such as The WordPress Codex and EasyWPGuide.
