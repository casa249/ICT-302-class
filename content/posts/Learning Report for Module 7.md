I have not learned too much on identifying key concepts this week, but I have been given a further understanding of concepts like HTML and the process of creating posts on other CMSs.
I can describe differences in CMSs such as general and specific features and organization.
I have become better at managing content through workflows by using Microsoft Teams.
I can use technolgies such as _Microsoft Teams_ and _WordPress_ for content management.
I have used resources such as https://www.w3schools.com/html/ for self-directed learning.
