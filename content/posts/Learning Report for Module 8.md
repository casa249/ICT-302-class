I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content management such as: 
* usability 
I can describe and compare content management system qualities like speed vs heavy coding. 
I can manage content using established workflows using editing features in sites like Wordpress. 
I have not found any new CMS's this week, but I have strengthened my grip on sites I already know like Wordpress. 
I can find and use resources such as _wordpress tutorials_ and _help pages_ for self-directed learning.
