I can identify key concepts such as the type of coding a certain CMS requires for content management.
I can compare different content management systems such as academic CMS's like Canvas and Business CMS's like Shopify.
I can manage workflows such as group projects by using features such as conversation posts in CMS's like teams to make a chart of who is doing what for one (or more) assignments.
I can find and use things such as plugins for CMS's to aid my content management.
I can use resources such as the **WordPress Official Support Page** for self-directed learning.
